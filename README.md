# React GunDB Demo
GunDB is an easy-to-use peer-to-peer decentralized database that will allow you to store data on a network of individual users, instead of a singular server. Each peer in the app's network stores some amount of the web app's data, but in aggregate, the entire network will contain all the necessary information.
